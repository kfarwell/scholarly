<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>My name is <a href="http://shlomotion.io/">Shlomo</a>. I’m an alum from the University of Waterloo who’s fascinated with the web and visual information. I’ve spent a lot of my time in the Fine Arts building at UW and absolutely love how it feels. There’s just something about being in it that intrigues me so much.</p>

<p>One thing that particularly peaks my interest are the hallways. I love how throughout the term, different courses and projects are featured on the walls. Paintings, sculptures, various images and new media art are displayed every term.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about a way of documenting student work and featuring them online. My ultimate vision for this is to be able to explore various courses and ideas through the work of students, from various disciplines in different institutions around the world.</p>

<p>I'm currently building this site with <a href="http://kfarwell.org/">Kyle Farwell</a>.</p>

<p>Reach out to me if you’re interested in working together on this, or just having a coffee, tea or some hot chocolate and picking each others thoughts</p>
